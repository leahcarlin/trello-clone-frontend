## Reflection

- Project was fun to do!
- There are some details / features I would add if I had more time
  -- EditCard component/pop-up would have an Edit button on values title & description. Input would only show when Edit button is clicked.
  -- Implement a drag & drop feature instead of select dropdown to move cards to another list
  -- Identify a way to have the "Add Card" feature at the bottom of each list like the Trello app has.
  -- Implement other features to the EditCard component i.e. adding label feature to organize content, due date feature.
