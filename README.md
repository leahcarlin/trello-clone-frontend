# Trello Clone App

This is a simple react app that uses only React for state-management.
The challenge was to build a clone of a Trello board in 4 hours.

## SETUP How to use this template

1. Clone the app

```
git clone git@github.com:YOUR_GITHUB_NAME/YOUR_PROJECT_NAME.git
```

2. cd into your project

```
cd YOUR_PROJECT_NAME
```

3. install dependencies

```
npm install
```

4. Start development server with npm start

```
npm start
```

## Reflection

- Project was fun to do!
- There are some details / features I would add if I had more time
  - I'm working on a couple typescript projects at the moment in order to better master Typescript. If I had more time, I would have done this in ts!
  - EditCard component/pop-up would have an Edit button on values title & description. Input would only show when Edit button is clicked.
  - Implement a drag & drop feature instead of select dropdown to move cards to another list
  - Identify a way to have the "Add Card" feature at the bottom of each list like the Trello app has.
  - Implement other features to the EditCard component i.e. adding label feature to organize content, due date feature.
